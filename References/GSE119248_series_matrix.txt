!Series_summary	"In order to investigate how electrophysiological properties vary within the Pthlh population in the dorsolateral striatum we performed PatchSeq analysis of neurons labeled in 5HT3a(EGFP) and Pvalb(cre)::RCE/tdTomato mouse lines, which included Th, Npy/Mia, Cck, and Cck/Vip expressing cells."
!Series_overall_design	"98 FACS-sorted single cells isolated from the dorso-lateral striatum from either a 5ht3a-EGFP mouse line or a Lhx6-cre mouse crossed onto a R26R-tdTomato reporter mouse line"
!Series_type	"Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing"

The plate was put in the Fluidigm C1 and the mRNA Seq: RT + Amp (1772x/1773x) script was executed, which took about 8.5 hours and included lysis, reverse transcription and 21 cycles of PCR. When the run finished, the amplified cDNA was harvested in a total of 13 microL C1 Harvesting Reagent and quantified on an Agilent BioAnalyzer. The typical yield was 1 ng/microL. Amplified cDNA was simultaneously fragmented and barcoded by tagmentation, i.e. using Tn5 DNA transposase to transfer adapters to the target DNA. 96 different 10x transposome stocks (6.25 microM barcoded adapter C1-TN5-x, 40% glycerol, 6.25 microM Tn5 transposase, where x denotes a well-specific barcode) were prepared, each with a different barcode sequence.  6 microL harvested cDNA was mixed with 5 microL tagmentation buffer (50 mM TAPS-NaOH pH 8.5, 25 mM MgCl2 and 50% DMF), 11.5 microL nuclease-free water and 2.5 microL 10x transposome stock. The mix was incubated for 5 minutes at 55 degeees C then cooled on ice. 100 microL Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 beads were washed in 2xBWT (10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 2 M NaCl, 0.02% Tween-20) then resuspended in 2 mL 2xBWT. 20 microL beads was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. All fractions were pooled, the beads were immobilized and the supernatant removed (thus removing all internal fragments, and retaining only the 5'- and 3'-most fragments). The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL TNT (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.02% Tween), washed in 100 microL Qiagen Qiaquick PB, then twice in 100 microL TNT. The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL restriction mix (1x NEB NEBuffer 4, 0.4 U/microL PvuI-HF enzyme), designed to cleave 3' fragments carrying the PvuI recognition site. The mix was incubated for one hour at 37 degrees C, then washed three times in TNT. Finally, the single-stranded library was eluted by resuspending the beads in 100 microL 100 mM NaOH, incubating for 5 minutes, removing the beads, then adding 100 microL 100 mM HCl and 50 microL Neutralization buffer (200 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween-20).
